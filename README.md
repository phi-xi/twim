    Place a copy of this folder into the server's WWW directory
    with the images to be managed. The 'ims' directory contains
    a .htaccess file to protect the directory; note to edit
    this file for secure configuration.

    Limits for image file size and image count in the managed
    directory and allowed image formats can be set in the
    file 'config.json' (the only file for configuration).
